Task : Adding category programmatically, and making categories name prefix to the product name ​

For adding the category, install script was used.​

For adding the prefix to the product name plugins were used.​

In creating categories, create() is used to create a object or instance.​

Magento's categoryInterfaces has getter and setter methods, in this I used setParentId() to setting the root categories node value, so that I can create the custom categories, under this node,​

Along with this setName() was used to setting the name for the custom category.​

And setIsActive() is used to make the category active.​

In the Magneto's catalog product class, the product name, product price it can be collected.​

Used after plugin, so that once the magento's observingmethod was called-out, the custom method will show its effect of their own.​
